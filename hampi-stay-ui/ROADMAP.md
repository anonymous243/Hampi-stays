## 💰 Commission Model
> Paid by the Resort Owner per confirmed booking. Travellers are NOT charged any extra fee.

### Tiered Commission Structure
| Tier | Rate | When Applied |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Standard** | 7% | All regular bookings |
| **Featured Listing** | 10% | Resort opts in for top search placement |
| **Peak Season** | 10% | Auto-applied Oct – Feb (Hampi tourist rush) |

### How It Works
- [ ] Commission is auto-calculated at checkout on the booking subtotal
- [ ] Razorpay / Stripe splits the payment: resort gets their share, platform fee is held separately
- [ ] Resort owner sees commission deducted clearly in their payout summary
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows total commission earned per booking / per month
- [ ] Payouts to resort owners are processed after guest check-in (not before) — protects against fraud

### Example
> ₹2,000/night × 2 nights = ₹4,000 booking
> - **7% Standard** → You earn ₹280, Resort gets ₹3,720
> - **10% Featured** → You earn ₹400, Resort gets ₹3,600

---

## 🔐 Security & Architecture Standards
> Every line of code must follow these non-negotiable standards

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] JWT tokens with short expiry (15 min access token + 7 day refresh token)
- [ ] Refresh token rotation (invalidate old token on every refresh)
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) — Traveller / Resort Owner / Super Admin
- [ ] Super Admin route protected by both credentials + secret route URL
- [ ] All protected routes verified server-side (never trust frontend-only auth)
- [ ] Rate limiting on all auth endpoints (prevent brute force attacks)
- [ ] Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts

### Data Encryption
- [ ] End-to-end HTTPS (TLS 1.3) — all data in transit is encrypted
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
- [ ] Sensitive data (payment info, personal details) encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- [ ] Payment card data NEVER stored — handled entirely by Razorpay/Stripe (PCI-DSS compliant)
- [ ] Environment variables for all secrets (never hardcoded)

### API Security
- [ ] Input validation & sanitization on all API endpoints (prevent SQL injection, XSS)
- [ ] CORS restricted to allowed origins only
- [ ] Helmet.js (or equivalent) for HTTP security headers
- [ ] API rate limiting per user/IP
- [ ] Request payload size limits
- [ ] All API responses sanitized (never expose internal errors to client)

### Payment Security
- [ ] Razorpay / Stripe webhook signature verification
- [ ] Idempotency keys on all payment requests (prevent duplicate charges)
- [ ] Server-side price calculation only (never trust client-sent price)
- [ ] Commission auto-deducted server-side before payout
- [ ] All transactions logged with full audit trail

### Infrastructure & Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled everywhere (no `any` types)
- [ ] ESLint + Prettier enforced on all code
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic (booking, commission calc, auth)
- [ ] Integration tests for all API endpoints
- [ ] Error boundaries on frontend (no raw crashes)
- [ ] Graceful error handling — meaningful messages, never stack traces to client
- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements (prevent SQL injection)
- [ ] Regular dependency audits (`npm audit`) to catch vulnerable packages
- [ ] Git secrets scanning (prevent API keys being pushed to GitHub)

### Scalability & Future-Proofing
- [ ] Backend built as RESTful API (can add mobile app later without changes)
- [ ] Database schema versioned with migrations (never alter tables manually)
- [ ] Feature flags for rolling out new features safely
- [ ] Logging & monitoring (track errors in production — Sentry / LogRocket)
- [ ] Horizontal scaling ready (stateless backend, no in-memory sessions)
